# React Test / Learning App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am using it to learn React. This will use the dog.ceo API to pull random dog images with the ability to select specific breeds.

Since this is me learning there might be issues here in this code and I might not be following best practices (if you notice that please feel free to point it out). Thanks!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
